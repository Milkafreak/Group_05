NOVA SBE Advanced Programming Class Group Project Summer 2022

This project was conducted by Bilal El Ahrach, Lotfi Chakchouk, Potsa Tamas and Edwin Gall as a deliverable for the 2022 Class of Advanced Programming at NOVA SBE in Carcavelos, Portugal. 

The showcase notebook should show the different methods that are part of the energy-class.py file. Dependecies can be found in the Environments folder with the -yml file. Other dependencies are programmed methods in the methods folder. 

Only the showcase notebook should be run, to give the user an overview of GDP, emissions and energy consumption. Further analysis is done on the example of Morocco, France and China, while other countries can be chosen by changing the variables. 

The underlying dataset  (Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/energy-data/master/owid-energy-data.csv)is a dataset with consumption and production of different energy sources from countries aroudn the world. 

In the showcase notebook we show developed methods to analyze the GDP, energy consumption and emission of some countries.
